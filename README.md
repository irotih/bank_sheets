# Bank
Bank is a Google Sheet for recording a bank balance. Typically (in the US) children under the age of 13 cannot open a traditional bank account. This application is designed for parents to track their kids' savings like a real bank would in order to teach them how bank accounts work, e.g. deposits, withdrawals, interest.

## Intended Use
As a parent and/or legal guardian, you would childrens' earnings into your own savings account. You would then use the Bank application to keep track of how much money actually belongs to your children. Whenever your child wants to spend their money, record the withdrawal in Bank. Keep the Interest Rate (APY) field updated in the application so that it also generates the monthly interest payments. Interest is compounded daily and deposited at the end of each month.

## Trust
If you follow the above instructions, you will see that Google wants you to really make sure you can trust this application. If you know me, you can trust it. If you don't know me, you shouldn't trust it. Visit my other repo [bank_apps_script](https://github.com/michael-cheung-nz2/bank_apps_script) to download the source code. You can read through it if you like and you can also create your own bank library instead of using mine (I'll publish instructions in the future).

## Upgrading
There is currently no way to perform upgrades on the Bank application. If a new version is released, just copy the new version and copy all the transactions from the old Sheet to the new one.
